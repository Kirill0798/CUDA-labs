# Genetic Algorithm

## Overview
Algorithm is find N polynomial coefficients for approximateing the function sin(x) on the sector (0, Pi) due to genetic algorithm.
There are two versions of calculating: on CPU and on GPU. In second variant I've used PyCUDA to parallelize genetic's breeding; random numbers were generated by CuRAND

Inputs:
- Points number
- Individuals number
- Expectation of gen's mutation
- Dispersion of gen's mutation
- Epochs count
- Max number of epochs where values of the fitness are same

Outputs:
- Fitness's value of the best child at each epochs
- Average epoch's work time 
- Approximating function
- Number of epoch with the best result

This issue was developed on google coolab.
